        You are all set! You will receive notifications indicating when to
        connect and disconnect the charger. Feel free to exit the app.
        \n\nPlease note that the app is designed to run automatically in the
        background, even after rebooting your phone. However, on certain
        devices, you may need to open the security settings and grant explicit
        permission for it to do so.
        \n\nSome devices terminate all background services when an app is
        removed from memory. If this applies to your device, you will need to
        \'lock\' the app in memory to prevent this from happening. Also make
        sure that the app is excluded from battery optimization.

        You are not set up yet! In order for the app to function properly, you
        need to grant it the necessary permissions. Please restart the app or
        go to your system settings and grant it notification permission.
